# Project Implementation Instructions

*This document contains the original implementation steps followed during the project development.*

## Setup Phase
1. Created Azure DevOps organization and project
2. Initialized repository with application code
3. Configured branch policies for main branch protection

## CI Pipeline Implementation
1. Created YAML-based build pipeline with the following stages:
   - Source code checkout
   - Dependency restoration
   - Build compilation
   - Unit test execution
   - Code quality analysis
   - Container image creation
   - Artifact publishing

## CD Pipeline Implementation
1. Configured release pipeline with multiple environments:
   - Development (automatic deployment)
   - Testing (manual approval required)
   - Production (manual approval required)
2. Implemented environment-specific variable groups
3. Added post-deployment validation tests

## Infrastructure Setup
1. Created Azure Resource Manager templates for:
   - App Service Plan and Web App
   - Database resources
   - Networking components
   - Monitoring resources
2. Implemented secure storage of secrets using Azure Key Vault

## Monitoring Configuration
1. Set up Application Insights for application monitoring
2. Created custom dashboards for key metrics
3. Configured alerts for critical thresholds

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Pipeline timeouts during extended test runs
   **Solution**: Optimized test execution and parallelized test suites

2. **Challenge**: Secret management across environments
   **Solution**: Implemented Azure Key Vault integration with pipelines

3. **Challenge**: Configuration drift between environments
   **Solution**: Moved all configuration to Infrastructure as Code templates
